In this approach, an identity provider (IdP) computes a time-varying confidence score for an asserted attribute that the IdP includes in a security assertion returned to a service provider. The confidence score typically is ‚Äúdeteriorating‚Äù (i.e., diminishes over time) for an attribute value. The degree to which the score deteriorates, however, may be altered by one or more qualified attribute verification event(s). Preferably, the IdP maintains a profile of the service provider, and that profile may also include other information, such as a threshold for an attribute confidence score that the SP deems acceptable (to enable access to the service). Based on the SP profiling, the IdP also can recommend use of a given identity issuer for a specific attribute.","tags":[],"title":"Identity attribute confidence scoring while certifying authorization claims (US Patent)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

While this classic method of granting consent is familiar to the parties involved, it involves little accountability or ongoing access oversight. Parents are asked to sign multiple permission forms, but are not given an efficient manner by which they can differentiate between fields for consent nor keep track of usage. Blockchain technology represents a promising approach for developing `smart contracts', digital promises to be executed without reliance upon a legal intermediary. Utilizing Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer, we propose a framework of nested authorization, allowing a public school data administrator the ability to grant authorization rights to a third party afterschool intervention program and their volunteers, who meet with parents and obtain consent for data access rights relying on smart contracts. These data consent signatures allow researchers the ability to design targeted inventions, meeting the needs of the community.","tags":[],"title":"Blockchain for Student Data Privacy and Consent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shlok Gilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499817600,"objectID":"dd580fa3881ec327d9438531c96828d8","permalink":"https://shlokgilda.github.io/publication/source_code/","publishdate":"2017-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/source_code/","section":"publication","summary":"Programming languages are the primary tools of the software development industry. As of today, the programming language of the vast majority of the published source code is manually specified or programmatically assigned based solely on the respective file extension. This work shows that the identification of the programming language can be done automatically by utilizing an artificial neural network based on supervised learning and intelligent feature extraction from the source code files. We employ a multi-layer neural network - word embedding layers along with a Convolutional Neural Network - to achieve this goal. Our criteria for an automatic source code identification solution include high accuracy, fast performance, and large programming language coverage. The model achieves a 97% accuracy rate while classifying 60 programming languages.","tags":[],"title":"Source code classification using Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shlok Gilda","Husain Zafar","Chintan Soni","Kshitija Waghurdekar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1490140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490140800,"objectID":"2176adae524320a9a39b370004e45232","permalink":"https://shlokgilda.github.io/publication/music_player/","publishdate":"2017-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/music_player/","section":"publication","summary":"Songs, as a medium of expression, have always been a popular choice to depict and understand human emotions. Reliable emotion based classification systems can go a long way in helping us parse their meaning. However, research in the field of emotion-based music classification has not yielded optimal results. In this paper, we present an affective cross-platform music player, EMP, which recommends music based on the real-time mood of the user. EMP provides smart mood based music recommendation by incorporating the capabilities of emotion context reasoning within our adaptive music recommendation system. Our music player contains three modules: Emotion Module, Music Classification Module and Recommendation Module. The Emotion Module takes an image of the user's face as an input and makes use of deep learning algorithms to identify their mood with an accuracy of 90.23%. The Music Classification Module makes use of audio features to achieve a remarkable result of 97.69% while classifying songs into 4 different mood classes. The Recommendation Module suggests songs to the user by mapping their emotions to the mood type of the song, taking into consideration the preferences of the user.","tags":[],"title":"Smart music player integrating facial emotion recognition and music mood recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
